Google challenge of Level 1 -  Android build. Made for one of challenges at foobar withgoogle.


First level exercise from google challenges.

Required skills:

-Looping. -Conditions. - Basic Array operations.

To be noted:
This requires us to basicly read each character and assign a new character to it, based on a set of rules we write.
Than we throw this character into new Array to get the result String.
